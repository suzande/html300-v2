    <h1 class="display-1">About Bootstrap</h1>

    <h2 class="display-6">The Team</h2>
    <p class="text-center">Bootstrap is maintained by a small team of developers on GitHub. We’re actively looking
      to grow this team and would love to hear from you if you’re excited about CSS at scale,
      writing and maintaining vanilla JavaScript plugins, and improving build tooling processes
      for frontend code.
    </p>

    <h2 class="display-2 text-center lh-base">History</h2>
    <p>Originally created by a designer and a developer at Twitter, Bootstrap has
      become one of the most popular front-end frameworks and open source projects in the world. <br>
      Bootstrap was created at Twitter in mid-2010 by @mdo and @fat. Prior to being an open-sourced
      framework, Bootstrap was known as Twitter Blueprint. A few months into development, Twitter held
      its first Hack Week and the project exploded as developers of all skill levels jumped in without
      any external guidance. It served as the style guide for internal tools development at the company
      for over a year before its public release, and continues to do so today. <br>
      Originally released on Friday, August 19, 2011, we’ve since had over twenty releases, including
      two major rewrites with v2 and v3. With Bootstrap 2, we added responsive functionality to the
      entire framework as an optional stylesheet. Building on that with Bootstrap 3, we rewrote the
      library once more to make it responsive by default with a mobile first approach.<br>
      With Bootstrap 4, we once again rewrote the project to account for two key architectural changes: a
      migration to Sass and the move to CSS’s flexbox. Our intention is to help in a small way to move
      the web development community forward by pushing for newer CSS properties, fewer dependencies, and new
      technologies across more modern browsers.
